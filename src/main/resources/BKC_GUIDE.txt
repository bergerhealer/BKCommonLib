=== For dev-bukkit plugin validation staff ===

The purpose of this file is to give you an idea of how BKCommonLib is built up.
You can ignore this, but it may help greatly in understanding how it is built up.

1.) Dependencies are shaded in:

CGLib is shaded in at:
  com\bergerkiller\bukkit\common\sf\cglib
It is only used here:
  com\bergerkiller\bukkit\common\entity\nms\NMSClassBuilder
To construct entities with controller functionality.
If this is an issue, please contact the authors so they can include about 120
Entity hook classes in BKCommonLib instead. It's what you like best.

Objensis is shaded in at:
  com\bergerkiller\bukkit\common\org\objenesis
It is used in various places to construct classes without calling their constructors.
Main use cases are constructing a World instance without registering it within the server.
Another use case is BlockState construction from tile entity - bypassing the Block method
is needed. Objensis is directly used in ClassTemplate, when calling newInstanceNull.

2.) Internal

The plugin itself, with all plugin-required functionality, is in the internal sub-package.
In there various listeners and tasks are set up to provide functionality that requires this.
If you are looking for an /op hack, big chance you'll find it there :) (but you won't)

The same accounts for PluginBase.

3.) There is no code generation going on to bypass package versioning. BKCommonLib
uses too much NMS to even make this possible. We decided to let it break every new build
to avoid people using broken software. In addition, we added a Minecraft version check
before enabling. This avoids people complaining when things break.

4.) Good luck!
We respect your duty on dev-bukkit and are aware of how many scriptkiddies try to let
admins run malicious plugins. You are doing an amazing job, so keep it up!
